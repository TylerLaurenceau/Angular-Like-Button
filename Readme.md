###Objective
Using an AngularJS module, controller and some built in directives, build a like button. The button should keep track of how many times it has been clicked and update its count each time it is clicked again. There should be a second button that toggles whether clicks are added or subtracted.


###Learning Objective
* Understand how AngularJS $scope works within controllers and your HTML.
* Know how to use directives and binding to react to user interactions.
